A simple demo chat app built on Node.js, Express.js and Socket.io.

# Pre-requisites
To setup and run the project for local development / testing, you will need to use Node.js and NPM. I don't explicitly specify a minimum Node.js/NPM version for the app but I recommend going with whatever the latest LTS version is at the point in time you are setting things up. The minimum vesion of Node.js that I have tested this app on is 10.16.3.

Installers can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

# Installation

You can clone the Repo to a local folder on your machine or download and extract the archive if you don't have Git installed.


Open a terminal window session, or the equivalent on your machine, and enter the following command to install all the Node modules needed to run the app:

`npm install`
`npm install express socket.io`

# Testing the chat app

Start the server by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
`node app.js`
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/. You should see the chat appâ€™s main page.

Open a second web browser window or tab and navigate to the same URL.

In one of the windows, enter a message in the text input field and click the Send button. The message should appear in both windows.
